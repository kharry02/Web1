<p> I've watched those eyes light up with a smile
  <br> River in the not good times
  <br> Oh, you taught me all that I know(I know)
  <br> I've seen your soul grow just like a rose
  <br> Made it through all of those thorns
  <br> Girl into the woman I know
</p>
<p> And it's killing me, me to say "I'm fine," "I'm fine"
  <br> When I really mean, mean to say...
</p>
<p> You're my all and more
  <br> All I know you taught me, yeah
  <br> You're my all and more
  <br> But I need room to breathe, yeah

<p> I found New York laying in your arms
  <br> We'll melt into the bedroom floor
  <br> Never knew I'd stay for so long
  <br> And this truth cuts not through one, but both
  <br> Not through one, but both of us
  <br> But it's deeper if I hold on
</p>
<p> And it's killing me, me to say "I'm fine," "I'm fine"
  <br> When I really mean, mean to say...
</p>
<p> You're my all and more
  <br> All I know you taught me, yeah
  <br> You're my all and more
  <br> But I need room to breathe, yeah
</p>
<p> Ooh-oh-oh
  <br> Ooh-oh-oh
  <br> Ooh-oh-oh
</p>
<p> Gotta breathe for me, it's now or never
  <br> Gotta breathe for me, it's now or never (Ooh-oh-oh)
  <br> Ooh-oh-oh
  <br> Ooh-oh-oh
  <br> Ooh-oh-oh
  <br> I should leave, 'cause you deserve better, better
  <br> Gave my all and more
  <br> But I need room to be me
</p>
<p> You're my all and more
  <br> All I know you taught me, yeah (Ooh-oh-oh, Ooh-oh-oh)
  <br> You're my all and more
  <br> But I need room to breathe, yeah (Ooh-oh-oh, Ooh-oh-oh, Ooh-oh-oh)
  <br> Ooh-oh-oh
  <br> Ooh-oh-oh
  <br> Ooh-oh-oh
</p>
<p> breathe
  <br> Ooh-oh-oh
  <br> Ooh-oh-oh
  <br> Ooh-oh-oh
  <br> breathe

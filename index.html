<h2><strong><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Novel" target="_blank" title="html5 specification">About the Novel</a></strong></h2>
<p> A novel is a relatively long work of narrative fiction, normally written in prose form, and which is typically published as a book.
  <br> The present English word for a long work of prose fiction derives from the Italian: novella for "new", "news", or "short story of something new", itself from the Latin: novella, a singular noun use of the neuter plural of novellus, diminutive of novus, meaning "new".
